This is a project that reads in commoncrawl webscraped news articles, cleans them, sorts them on whether they are financially related or not, and then 
performs sentiment analysis via a bag of words approach. 

to get started, read the instructions in train_fin_classfier.py for training your own model,
then place the model in the models folder and you can follow the isntructions in sentiment_long_optim.py to run sentiment analysis on the sorted commoncrawl articles. 

While there is still more to be done, this is a neat tool for gauging sentiment and comparing it to market performance over the several past years and in real time.
